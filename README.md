## Development

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed and then install all dev dependencies after cloning the repository.
You can then run the examples in your browser as a live development environment.

```sh
# install dev dependencies
npm install
# run examples
npm run examples
```

By default, the examples will be hosted at http://localhost:1234/index.html.

      Note that all three embryo illustrations are shown in side view.

      The fish embryo is long, narrow and straight. Its head is small, round,
      and contains gill arches. A large flap extends to the left, from just
      below the head to the middle of the embryo. A segmented bony structure
      runs the length of the embryo on the right.

    <p>
      The reptile embryo is much longer and fatter than the fish embryo, but is
      curled into a fetal position. Its head is bent forward and is twice as
      large as that of the fish embryo. The reptile embryo has twice as many
      gill arches as the fish embryo, but the flap on the left side is only half
      as long. A segmented bony structure runs the length of the embryo on the
      right.

    <p>
      The bird embryo is curved more than the fish embryo, but is not as long or
      as curved as the reptile embryo. The head of the bird embryo is almost as
      large as the reptile embryo, but has fewer gill arches. A flap the same
      size as that of the reptile embryo extends to the left. A segmented bony
      structure runs the length of the embryo on the right. Arrows point to the
      gill arches of all three embryos.
